This program creates hard* rook jumping puzzles. What is a rook jumping puzzle?
Imagine that you have a chessboard of size N by N.
In chess, a rook is a unit that can move in any direction horizontally or vertically.
In this puzzle, it can only move the exact number of squares that it is given.
The rook starts on the top left corner (0,0) and ends at the bottom right corner (N, N) denoted by a 0.
The rook must jump in that manner in order to try to get from the start to the finish.

*It utilizes a variety of algorithms in order to create a solvable but difficult puzzle, with clear function names.

Inputs:
A number between 5 and 10 for the dimension sizes.
